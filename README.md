*   **Brand Identity:** Includes company logo, name, and location.
*   **Contact Integration:** Direct links for Email and Instagram.

## 🛠️ Customization

To modify the content, open `index.html` in any text editor.

*   **Logo:** Replace `assets/logo.png` with your own logo file.
*   **Text:** Edit the text inside the `<h1>` and `<p>` tags.
*   **Links:** Update the `href` attributes in the `.contact-info` section.

## 📦 Deployment

1.  Upload `index.html` and the `assets` folder to the public directory of your hosting provider (e.g., `public_html`).
2.  Ensure existing files like `index.php` or `default.html` are removed or renamed so this page takes precedence.
